you are hurting both the aurat march and the aurat azadi march by misquoting and spreading misinformation please fix immediately and issue an apology so people dont think the 6th march jalsa in f9 park is cancelled dont you fact check before publishing
hello you have misquoted dr bari please change this asap she clearly said the jalsa was moved to 6th march and not entirely cancelled as you reported please have some journalistic integrity and fix your mistake and issue an apology thank you
